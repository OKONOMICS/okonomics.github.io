      <h1>What is Geopolitics</h1>
      <p> 
        To undestand the why of the economy we need to understand the how the planet works. The three main factors to consider are Geography, or how
        the planet and its resources are placed; Politics, or how people behave and the organisation of states and History,what has happend in the past.
      </p>
      <h2>Geopgraphy</h2>
      <p> 
        The importance of where everything is placed on the globe is key to comprehend the why of politics. Resources as a fact will always be unevenly 
        distributed, as natural recourses form mainly from external geological or biological processes. Humans then group themselves naturally around these 
        resources and establish monopolies of control that help them grow. This aggrupation’s over time have come to be defined as societies, business or even 
        communes. For simplicity, we are grouping all these concepts them into governments, as they provide the same theoretical purpose.
      </p>
      <h2>Politics</h2>
      <p> 
        The relations of these diverse governments are the next step to comprehend reality. The relations between each government tend to reflect the prosperity of each 
        region of the planets. Modern aggrupation of governments forms the concept of the State, which is allowed to eject ultimate violence, or as its labeled inside these, 
        legality. Different states then group the resources to start massive projects, such as wars main aim of establishing economic monopolies or increase the productivity of 
        a region they administer.

        <h1>What is Economics?</h1>
        <p> We often hear about economics from the media or even the street. It's a term used in a lot of different arranging 
          from what politics to business. The definition of economics states that economics is the social science that studies
          the forces of supply and demand and how resources are allocated, focusing on aspects as production and consumption.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What does this mean</h2>
        
        <p> First, we need to understand that our world has limited resources as there are finite trees, metals, computers, 
          phones and so on but in other hand human needs and desires are infinite. The problem that economics tries to solve is
          how resources can be distributed efficiently in order to satisfy the maximum quantity of needs at the same time.
        </p>

        <p> Economics subdivides into two subdisciplines Macroeconomics and Microeconomics. While microeconomics study how 
          individuals and films take decisions to distribute resources, Macroeconomics tries to explain economic behavior as a 
          whole using indicators such as output, unemployment or inflation.
        </p>
        <h2>What do economist do?</h2>
          
        <p> The economist’s job is to analyze economic data to help economic agents such as governments institution individual's
          and business to take good decisions.  
        </p>
   
        <h2> which are the most known indicators </h2> 
           
        <p> First, we have GDP which measure the total output of an economy generally as GDP grows a nation tends to get richer. 
          we have an unemployment which tackles how many people which are in the age of working which constitutes 16 or more and 
          active search of job do currently not have a job. CPI is consumer price index which is a most common way to track   
          evolution of prices.
        </p>
            
        
        <p> So what is the conclusion so what we know that economics originates for limited resources and unlimited needs second 
          it subdivides into micro and macro, which studies small scale and large scale and the most important indicators include GDP     
          unemployment and CPI.

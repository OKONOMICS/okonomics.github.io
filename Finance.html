    <div><h1>Introduction to Financial Markets</h1></div>

      <div>
        <h2>What are financial markets?</h2>
        <p> Imagine a big marketplace where people buy and sell different things. In the financial world, 
          this marketplace is called "financial market." But instead of buying and selling your favorite 
          phone or car, people here buy and sell, financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, commodities,
          derivatives), in hopes of getting a future return but it also constitutes an important way to raise 
          capital and liquidity for big companies.,Some of the financial market participants include (Banks, 
          investors, governments, institutions and individuals like you and me).
          </p>
          <p>First, we distinguish between primary and secondary markets, primary markets are where securities 
            are sold for the first time, such as IPO (initial public offering), where companies issue stocks for 
            the first time. But the most known markets are, the secondary market where previously issued securities 
            are bought and sold among investors on a daily basis.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>Stock markets</ul>
        <li> The most well-known of financial markets are stock markets. Where shares of companies are bought and sold 
          by traders and investors. Stock markets are a keyway for companies to raise capital and for investors to seek 
          returns. Some of the biggest stock markets is The NYSE an index which comprehends over 2000 stocks both from 
          USA and foreign.
        </li>
        <ul>Bond markets</ul>
        <li> Bonds are agreements between lenders and borrowers, in which the borrower or bond issuer has the obligation 
          to pay fixed interest amounts on preestablished dates to the lender, who is the bondholder. Bonds constitute a 
          way for corporations or governments to finance activities and represent secure instruments for investors to 
          receive their promised returns. 
          
        </li>
        <ul>Derivative Markets</ul>
        <li> The world of derivatives is vast and complex, but the main idea is that their value derives from an underlying 
          asset which can be bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, stocks and so on. An example of derivatives are 
          future contracts, which are contracts that Oblige the buyer to purchase, or the seller to sell, an asset at a 
          predetermined future date and price.  
          To make things simple, take for instance a farmer who worries about his wheat future price and a baker who needs wheat 
          but worries about future price fluctuations, in this case both arrange a future commodity contract in which the farmer 
          agrees to sell a specific quantity, at a fixed price and fixed date. 
          There exists two scenarios, if the Wheat price goes up after the specific date the baker benefits as it is getting the 
          wheat at a lower price than what it costs currently in the market, and second scenario where prices fall down after the 
          date, in which the farmer wins as it gets to sell at higher price than what it is sold currently in the market. In this 
          way both seller and buyer can assess future price risks. 
          
        </li>
        <ul>Forex Market</ul>
        <li> Being the largest and most liquid financial market In the world where participants buy and sell currencies, contrary to 
          other markets, Forex markets operate 24 H a day five days a week. It helps facilitate international trade and manage currency 
          risk.
        </li>
        <ul>Commodities Markets</ul>
        <li>Where raw goods or primary products are traded, categorized into hard commodities (like gold, oil, or agricultural products like 
          wheat), and soft commodities such as sugar, cocoa, or coffee. Playing a crucial role for risk management of the price of commodities. 
          One of the most know commodity markets is the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
        </li>
        <ul>Cryptocurrency Markets</ul>
        <li> And in the most years, cryptocurrency have become increasingly popular, cryptocurrencies are virtual decentralized currencies which 
          operate without intermediaries, one of the most known virtual currencies are Bitcoin, but fraudulent activities surrounding these assets 
          and its high imposed risks, are shifting opinions on whether these virtual coins constitute good assets to hold, in portfolios.
        </li>

        <h2>What are the best ways to operate in the financial markets?</h2>
        <p>One of the key aspects when diving into financial markets, is the capacity to assess risk, on general terms risk refers to the potential 
          adverse outcomes that participants can face due to various origins. One of the many common risks involved when operating in the markets, 
          is market risk which is the potential loss of an assets value due to market price fluctuations.
          </p>
          <p>Certainly, there is no clear answer to that, as there is no magic formula that will guarantee you future returns, but it should be noted that 
            having a clear structured plan with setting financial goals, a nice, planned diversification portfolio to asses risk and staying constantly 
            informed will always give you an edge when approaching financial markets.
